    "#### 1.2.1 What is Prompty?\n",
    "Prompty is a new asset class and file format for LLM prompts that aims to provide observability, understandability, and portability for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The tooling for Prompty comes together in three ways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**i. A prompty file:**\n",
    "- A Prompty file is not tied to any language as it uses the markdown format with YAML\n",
    "- The file contains two main parts:\n",
    "    - **Front Mattter:** \n",
    "        - This is the first part of the prompty file \n",
    "        - It is written in YAML and is contained inside two `---` seperators. \n",
    "        - It includes basic details about the prompt, the model configuration and prompty inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Prompt Template:** \n",
    "        - This is the base prompt that is sent to the LLM once the prompty is executed. \n",
    "        - It uses Jinja format to pass values either specified in the front matter or from the application to the LLM.\n",
    "        - Given *'name': Marlene*, the variable *{{name}}* will be replaced by *Marlene* at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ii. The VS Code extension tool:**\n",
    "- The Prompty extension allows you to run Prompty files directly in VS Code. \n",
    "- It has been pre-installed for this workshop, but you can also find it in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iii. Runtimes in multiple programming languages:**\n",
    "To execute a Prompty file asset in code, you can use one of the supporting runtimes such as:\n",
    "- [Prompty Core (python)](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty/blob/main/runtime/prompty/README.md) - The python Prompty core package is the base package needed to run a prompty asset file.\n",
    "- [Promptyflow (python)](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/tutorials/prompty-quickstart.html) - Use Prompty with Promptflow as your runtime and logic orchestrator.\n",
    "- [LangChain (python)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/partners/prompty) - Use the experimental LangChain Prompty runtime.\n",
    "- [Semantic Kernal (csharp)](https://www.developerscantina.com/p/semantic-kernel-prompty/) - Use the experimental Semantic Kernal Prompty runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. Building an AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us understand practically how we build an AI agent will build the **Researcher Agent** step by step.\n",
    "<br>In order to build the Researcher agent you will complete the following 3 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to build the researcher agent\n",
    "- [ ] Step 1: Build a multi-lingual query generator\n",
    "- [ ] Step 2: Give the query generator a list of functions available\n",
    "- [ ] Step 3: Build the tools and execute the research\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1:** Build a multi-lingual query generator\n",
    "- At it's core the researcher agent generates queries that can be used to look for information online. \n",
    "- It also allows us to find search results in multiple languages. \n",
    "- This can all be done using a single prompty file. \n",
    "- To see this in action open the [researcher-0.prompty](researcher/researcher-0.prompty) file and click the run button on the top right of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ To complete this step update the **sample** category in the front matter to change the instructions and include a market code to in the instructions to change the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2:** Give the query generator a list of functions available\n",
    "- In order for the researcher to generate even better queries it needs to know which search functions are avaialble to it. \n",
    "- Prompty allows us to pass information to the LLM in the form of a json file using the **${file:filename.json}** format, where **filename** is the name of an existing json file. \n",
    "- In this step we want to give the LLM a list of the functions (sometimes called tools) that it can choose from.\n",
    "- The LLM should examine the user instructions and return the name of the most appropriate function to use and the query that will be passed to that function as a parameter. \n",
    "- Examine the [functions.json](researcher/functions.json) file. You should see the **find_information**, **find_entities** and **find_news** functions. \n",
    "- Open the [researcher-1.prompty](researcher/researcher-1.prompty) file and note that **${file:functions.json}** has been added to tools under the parameters section in the front matter.\n",
    "- Click the run button on the top right of the file to see all of this in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ To complete this step update the instructions to influence which function the LLM chooses. \n",
    "<br>(For example to get the find_news function chosen use instructions: 'Can you find the latest news about Microsoft?')\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3:** Build the functions and execute the research\n",
    "- The researcher has now selected which function to use and has generated a query and possibly a market code to pass to it. \n",
    "- We now need to write the Python code for these functions that will pass the queries to the Bing Search API. \n",
    "- We will also use a function in Python to execute the prompty file, instead of running it manually in VS Code. \n",
    "- Open the the [researcher3.py](researcher/researcher3.py) file to see this code and try and understand what each function does. \n",
    "- To put everything together click the play button on the left of the jupyter notebook code cell below below.  \n",
    "- The cell calls the **research** function to run the code in researcher3.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ To complete this step run the code in the cell below and test it out with different instructions and languages. "
