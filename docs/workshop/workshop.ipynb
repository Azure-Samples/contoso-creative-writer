    "#### 1.2.1 What is Prompty?\n",
    "Prompty is a new asset class and file format for LLM prompts that aims to provide observability, understandability, and portability for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The tooling for Prompty comes together in three ways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**i. A prompty file:**\n",
    "- A Prompty file is not tied to any language as it uses the markdown format with YAML\n",
    "- The file contains two main parts:\n",
    "    - **Front Mattter:** \n",
    "        - This is the first part of the prompty file \n",
    "        - It is written in YAML and is contained inside two `---` seperators. \n",
    "        - It includes basic details about the prompt, the model configuration and prompty inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Prompt Template:** \n",
    "        - This is the base prompt that is sent to the LLM once the prompty is executed. \n",
    "        - It uses Jinja format to pass values either specified in the front matter or from the application to the LLM.\n",
    "        - Given *'name': Marlene*, the variable *{{name}}* will be replaced by *Marlene* at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ii. The VS Code extension tool:**\n",
    "- The Prompty extension allows you to run Prompty files directly in VS Code. \n",
    "- It has been pre-installed for this workshop, but you can also find it in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**iii. Runtimes in multiple programming languages:**\n",
    "To execute a Prompty file asset in code, you can use one of the supporting runtimes such as:\n",
    "- [Prompty Core (python)](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty/blob/main/runtime/prompty/README.md) - The python Prompty core package is the base package needed to run a prompty asset file.\n",
    "- [Promptyflow (python)](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/tutorials/prompty-quickstart.html) - Use Prompty with Promptflow as your runtime and logic orchestrator.\n",
    "- [LangChain (python)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/partners/prompty) - Use the experimental LangChain Prompty runtime.\n",
    "- [Semantic Kernal (csharp)](https://www.developerscantina.com/p/semantic-kernel-prompty/) - Use the experimental Semantic Kernal Prompty runtime.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1:** Build a multi-lingual query generator\n",
    "- At it's core the researcher agent generates queries that can be used to look for information online. \n",
    "- It also allows us to find search results in multiple languages. \n",
    "- This can all be done using a single prompty file. \n",
    "- To see this in action open the [researcher-0.prompty](researcher/researcher-0.prompty) file and click the run button on the top right of the file. \n",
    "- The generated results from the LLM will be displayed in the *output* tab in the terminal. \n",
    "\n",

    "    - Once you've run the above command you should see an `http://localhost:5173/` link in the terminal. \n",
    "    - Right click the link or click the **open on browser** button that comes up as a Gitub notification in the bottom right corner of the screen. \n",
    "    - If you see a page from Github select the **continue** button. If not skip you should already see your app. \n",
    "    - You should now see the app appear on your screen!\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ To complete this step confirm that you can see the Constoso Creative Writer application. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3:** Test the app\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can now test out the app by clicking **Example** to fill out the example information. Read the example instructions. \n",
    "- Click **Start Work** button to get Contoso Creative Writer to generate an article. \n",
    "- Click on the small **Debug** button at the bottom right of the Application to see which agent steps are carried out.\n",

    "## 4. Setting up automated evaluations and deployment with Github Actions \n",
    "\n",
    "Contoso Creative Writer is set up to run a CI/CD pipeline, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample code the CI/CD pipeline includes the following: \n",
    "1. **Build and Deploy:** Automatically building and deploying the latest version of the code in production (This helps us confirm things are working as expected.)\n",
    "2. **Evaulations:** Automatically running evaulations on a test article to see how fluent, grounded, relevant and coherent the final response was.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to run automated evaluations and deployment \n",
    "- [ ] Step 1: Run azd up to deploy your application to production\n",
    "- [ ] Step 2: Set up the azd pipeline configuration\n",
    "- [ ] Step 3: Allow workflows in Github\n",
    "- [ ] Step 4: Examine evaluations \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1:** Run azd up to deploy your application to production\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set up a CI/CD pipleline for this project we need to deploy our application to production. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the following command in the terminal to deploy the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    azd up\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- This step will likely take several minutes. So feel free to take a break by stretching and walking around!\n",
    "- Once complete scroll up in your terminal beyond any output from Github and look for *--- 🎉 | 4. Access your ACA deployed web app here:*\n",
    "- This is a link to your deployed application. \n",
    "- While the subscription is active you can share this link with friends to show them what you've built! \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2:** Set up the azd pipeline configuration\n",
    "We will set up the CI/CD pipeline with azd and GitHub actions. To do this **open a new terminal**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    azd pipeline config\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- select an environment name like yourname-aitour\n",
    "- select the recommended subscription by pressing enter\n",
    "- select `Canada East` as the Azure Location \n",
    "- When asked to Log in using the Github CLI type in `Y`\n",
    "- Choose `HTTPS` as the preferred protocol for Git Operations \n",
    "- Select `Y` to Authenticate with your Github credentials. \n",
    "- Choose Login with a web browser to authenticate Github CLI and follow the authentication instructions. \n",
    "- You may be asked if you want to commit and push your local changes. Choose `Y`\n",
    "- You should see two links in your terminal. Select the sencond link to view your pipeline status. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3:** Allow workflows in Github\n",
    "- You will now see a screen in Github that tells you workflows are not being run on the fork. \n",
    "- Click the green button that says 'I understand my workflows go ahead and enable them.'\n",
    "- If the screen is blank come back to the terminal and rerun the *azd pipeline config* command. \n",
    "- Again, select the sencond link to view your pipeline status. \n",
    "- You should now see the two Github action workflows running on the screen. \n",
    "- Look at the subheading of the actions and wait till the *Evaluate* one turns green. \n",
    "- It will likely take a few minutes to complete but once complete click the Evaulate action. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4:** Examine evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should see a table with some scores for relevance, fluencey, coherence and groundedness. \n",
    "- The scores are from 1-5, with 5 being the highest mark. These are used to help us know how well the model is performing.\n",
    "- Examine the evaluations and think of some ways you might be able to improve a score in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Congratulations you've succesfully automated evaluations and deployment🎉\n",
    "- [✅] Step 1: Run azd up to deploy your application to production\n",
    "- [✅] Step 2: Set up the azd pipeline configuration\n",
    "- [✅] Step 3: Allow workflows in Github\n",
    "- [✅] Step 4: Examine evaluations \n",
