### Welcome to the AI Tour and workshop WRK551!

In this session, you will learn how to build the app, **Contoso Creative Writer**. This app will assist the marketing team at Contoso Outdoors in creating trendy, well-researched articles to promote the companyâ€™s products.

### Pre-Requisites

To participate in this workshop, you will need:

1. Your own laptop.
    * It need only be capable of running a browser and GitHub Codespaces, so almost any laptop will do.
    * A recent version of Edge, Chrome or Safari is recommended.
2. A GitHub Account.
    * If you don't have one, you can [signup for a free account](https://github.com/signup) now.
    * After this workshop is complete, you will have a fork of the "contoso-creative-writer" repository in your GitHub account, which includes all the materials you will need to reproduce this workshop at home.


### To begin this lab follow these steps:

1. Confirm that you can see your **Azure Credentials** at the top of the page. 
    * You will use these to login to Azure Developer CLI (AZD) and Azure CLI (AZ) later. 

2.  Click on this link [https://aka.ms/contoso-creative-writer-codespace](https://aka.ms/contoso-creative-writer-codespace). This will take you to a page where you can open a Codespace for Contoso Creative Writer. 
    * If you are not logged into Github already you will need to login using **your own** GitHub account credentials. 

3. Click the green **<> Create codespace** button at the bottom of the page.
    * This will open a pre-built Codespace on main. 

    > **ðŸš§ IMPORTANT**: Do not open the GitHub Codespace on a fork of the repository, this would prevent you from using the prebuilt Codespace container image. Don't worry, you'll have the possibility to fork the repository later.

4. Once your Codespace is ready, **run the following command**:

++./docs/workshop/lab_setup.py --username "@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username" --password "@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password" --azure-env-name "AITOUR@lab.LabInstance.Id" --subscription "@lab.CloudSubscription.Id"++


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **If you are viewing this from the Skillable lab page**: The above are your unique azure credentials.
> - **If you are viewing this from Github**: The above are not your credentials. They are placeholders. Your actual credentials can be seen on the Skillable lab page.


5. Once the previous script is complete:
    * In the file explorer look for the **docs** folder and in it open the **workshop** folder. 
    * Open the **workshop-1-intro.ipynb** file. 
    * Follow the instructions to get going!

Have fun building!ðŸŽ‰
